-In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. 
-The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
-Capomulin and Ramicane have the highest proportion of observations in the data set.
-The proportion of female and male mice is almost the same.
-The proposed model suggests that over the course of 45 days, Capomulin was very effective against tumor development.
-The mean score for Tumor Volume (mm3) was subjected to multivariate analysis of variance to determine the tumor growth treated through a variety of drug regimens.
-What is striking in boxplot is the difference between Infubinol in comparison with Capomulin, Ramicane and Ceftamin. Infubinol is the only Drug regimen that could have outliers.
-What can be clearly seen in the Regression analysis is the relationship between the average of Tumor Volume and Weight.
